## List of Repositories
| Repository | Details |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Data-Analysis  | Contains details about each algorithm and the value analysis comparison between them. Hardware comparisons are also included for each component on the main PCB. |
| MATLAB  | Contains MATLAB Simulink file used for testing algorithms and the measured metrics for each one. Files that were used to estimate panel PV plots are also included. Within the revision folder, there   are initial test files that were created, but are not recommended for use.  |
| LTspice  | LTspice simulation for the synchronous DC – DC converter and the solar emulator circuit.  |
| PCB-DCDC-Test  | PCB and schematic files for the DC – DC converter test board.  |
| PCB-PM-Test  | PCB and schematic files for the power monitor test board.  |
| PCB-Main  | PCB and schematic files for the main PCB. PDF’s showing each layer of the board and the bill of materials with cost are included.  |
| MCU-Code  | Contains all files and libraries that are used for programming the Pico. |
| Test-Data-Scripts  | Solar panel Python scripts that graph data from CSV files. Collected data from numerous tests is also included, along with generated graphs. |
| MCU-Code-Testing  | Code files that were used to test various functionality with the Pico. Examples include testing I2C, ADC, or temperature sensor. |
| SDCard-Test  | Code files that were used to test the no-FatFS Pico library for writing to the micro-SD card. |
